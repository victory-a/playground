#   BuyCoins Front-end Skill Assessment 

The task was to implement a minimal responsive clone of github's repository page with a maximum of 20 repositories.

`Live URL: https://victory-buycoins.netlify.app/`

## Instructions  
To run the project;
1. open your terminal and navigate to `/github_clone`
2. run `npm install / yarn` in your terminal to download the dependencies
3. run `npm start` in your terminal to start up live server
4. run `npm run compile:sass` to sync further changes from the sass files

## Highlights
I tried to be particular about accessibility while making the output as close as possible to the real one.
